# DECISION_TREE
ðŸŽ¯ Decision Tree Classifier - Customer Purchase Prediction
This project implements a Decision Tree Classifier to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit (i.e., make a purchase) based on their demographic and behavioral data. The dataset used is the Bank Marketing Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
The goal of this project is to:

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the marketing dataset.

Preprocess data (handling categorical variables, missing values, encoding).

Train a Decision Tree model to classify customer responses.

Evaluate model performance with metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.

Visualize the decision tree structure for better interpretability.

ðŸ§  Technologies & Libraries
Python 3.8+

Pandas for data manipulation

NumPy for numerical operations

Matplotlib / Seaborn for data visualization

Scikit-learn for model building and evaluation

Graphviz or dtreeviz (optional) for visualizing the decision tree
